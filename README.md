# Search-Java-Indexer-Demo sample

This Java code sample for [Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/) demonstrates how to create and use a search indexer that retrieves data from an Azure Cosmos DB data source. This code pre-dates the Java SDK and uses the [Search Service REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/) to create, configure, and run the indexer.
